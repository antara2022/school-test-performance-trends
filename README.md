## School Test Performance Trends 

Analyzes District Wide Standardized Test Data Using Pandas

## Objectives:

### Step 1 - District Summary

- Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame

### Step 2 - School Summary

- Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school

### Step 3 - Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

- Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.
- Save the results in a DataFrame called "top_schools"

### Step 4 - Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

- Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.
- Save the results in a DataFrame called "bottom_schools"

### Step 5 - Math Scores by Grade

- Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school

### Step 6 - Reading Scores by Grade

- Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school

### Step 7 - Scores by School Spending

- Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student)
- Create four bins with reasonable cutoff values to group school spending
- Categorize spending based on the bins and create a new DataFrame

### Step 8 - Scores by School Size

- Create a DataFrame that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large)

### Step 9 - Scores by School Type

- Create a DataFrame that breaks down school performance based on school type (charter or district)
